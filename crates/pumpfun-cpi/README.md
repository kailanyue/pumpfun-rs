# Pump.fun Solana Program CPI

## Overview

This crate provides CPI (Cross-Program Invocation) bindings for interacting with the Pump.fun Solana program. Pump.fun is a Solana-based marketplace enabling users to create and distribute their own tokens, primarily memecoins.

The crate was automatically generated by [anchor-gen](https://github.com/saber-hq/anchor-gen) from the program's IDL (Interface Description Language) file, ensuring type-safe and reliable cross-program interactions.

## Features

- Type-safe CPI bindings for all Pump.fun program instructions
- Account validation and constraint checking
- Automatically generated account structs and instruction builders
- Full integration with Anchor's programming model
